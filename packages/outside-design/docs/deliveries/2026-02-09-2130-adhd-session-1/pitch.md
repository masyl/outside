# ADHD Session #1

## Motivation

Some sessions are intentionally opportunistic. The value comes from shipping several useful small/medium improvements quickly, without forcing a single strong motivation narrative.

## Solution

Run a special delivery mode where work is done incrementally based on immediate intent, with no implementation plan artifact.

## Inclusions

- Session-style delivery framing.
- Multiple small/medium improvements executed during the session.
- Final wrapup that lists what was actually delivered.

## Exclusions

- No implementation plan document.
- No predefined roadmap for the session.

## Pre-requisites

- Existing delivery documentation structure.

## Open Questions

- Should this become a recurring template with strict naming/rules?

## Next Logical Pitches

- Recurring session template (`ADHD SESSION #N`).
