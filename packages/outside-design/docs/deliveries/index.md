### About Deliveries

Deliveries are set of changes, that are added to the project as a coherent package. They containe a bunch of changes to the code, the original pitch, the implementation plan and various report that describe in details what has been delivered. Each delivery typically go through a quality check process before being automatically deployed to production and distributed.

This delivery process has been custom built for this project and is heavily assisted by agentic work and software automation in order to ensure the highest level of reliability and keep a good development velocity.

Not only does it provide a realtime view of ongoing changes, it also serves as a rich history of the original intent behind a lot of the design decisions made along the way. This history is invaluable both for monkeys in pants and any agentic coding tools.
