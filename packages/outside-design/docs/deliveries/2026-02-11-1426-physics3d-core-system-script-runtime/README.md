# Physics3D Core System Script Runtime (System Scripting series: 1)

This delivery promotes the first system-scripting pitch and scopes the initial migration of `physics3dSystem` to Lua-executed core scripts.

Implementation expanded beyond pitch 1 and now includes initial foundations for pitch 2 (external system hooks), pitch 3 (command scripts), and pitch 4 (event scripts), with deterministic execution and test coverage.
