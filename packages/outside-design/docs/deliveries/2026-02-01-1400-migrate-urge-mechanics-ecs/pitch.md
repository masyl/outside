# Migrate the walk, wait, wander, follow and urge mechanics

## Motivation

The new ECS simulation core is ready, but has very few systems yet. To see how the new core works, it's time to bring back mechanics from the legacy POC.

## Solution

Analyze and re-implement the walk, wait, wander, follow and urge mechanics in the new ECS core.

## Inclusions

- Stories to feature the new mechanics.
- Add new visual elements to the test renderer:
  - Follow lines
  - Vector arrow for directions and velocity.

## Exclusions

- Everything unless specified. This delivery should be fairly tight.

## Pre-requisites

- No known missing pre-requisites

## Open Questions

- TBD

## Next Logical Pitches

- TBD

## Implementation Details (use sparingly)

- TBD
