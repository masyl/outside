# Brief

A cluster of pointer-related commits landed while working in `feat/soccer-ball-prefab`. This brief separates that work from soccer-ball gameplay scope.

## Why this delivery exists

- Prevent scope mixing in delivery history.
- Preserve an accurate narrative for future maintenance.
- Keep soccer-ball documentation focused on soccer-ball mechanics only.

## Outcome summary

- Pointer variants and pointer zoo workflows are now documented as a standalone delivered slice.
- Soccer-ball delivery scope has been corrected to exclude pointer changes.
