# ADHD Session #1

## Motivation

Some work sessions are intentionally opportunistic: multiple small to medium fixes or improvements are tackled back-to-back based on immediate value, not a single strong narrative motivation.

The current process assumes a tighter motivation and heavier planning path for each delivery. That creates friction for sessions where the goal is pragmatic iteration and momentum.

## Solution

Introduce a session-style delivery format named `ADHD SESSION #1` with explicit rules:

- Motivation can be immediate intent ("felt like doing this now").
- No implementation plan document is required for this session type.
- Work proceeds as a sequence of small/medium changes until the session naturally ends.
- Wrapup must be factual and list what was actually done.

## Inclusions

- A dedicated pitch framing this session style.
- A promoted delivery entry under `docs/deliveries`.
- A wrapup document that states completed work only.

## Exclusions

- No roadmap for future milestones in this delivery.
- No detailed implementation plan artifact.
- No retroactive refactoring of older deliveries to this format.

## Pre-requisites

- Existing pitch and delivery documentation structure in `outside-design`.

## Open Questions

- Should this session style become a reusable template (e.g. `ADHD SESSION #N`) with naming and acceptance rules?
- Should there be a cap on scope or duration for session-style deliveries?

## Next Logical Pitches

- Session Delivery Template (`ADHD SESSION #N`) and governance rules.
- Lightweight test/report checklist for opportunistic delivery sessions.
