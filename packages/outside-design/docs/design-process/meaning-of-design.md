# Meaning of "Design"

Here, the word "design" is not limited to graphical or UI design.

It is used in the broadest sense possible: the practice of intentionally shaping
systems, behaviors, tools, workflows, and experiences without artificial
departmental partitions.

This documentation follows that cohesive approach so the project can preserve
intent and decision context across disciplines.
