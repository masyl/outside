# Design Process Overview

This section documents our design process for the Outside game project.

## Our Approach

We follow a user-centered design process that emphasizes research, ideation, and iteration.

graph LR;
    A["Research Phase"] --> B["Ideation Phase"];
    B --> C["Pitch Phase"];
    C --> D["Implementation"];
    D --> E["Wrapup"];
    E --> F["Deliveries"];

    click A "/design-process/research";
    click B "/design-process/ideation";
    click C "/design-process/pitch-phase";
    click F "/deliveries/";
```

## Process Stages

### 1. Research Phase

Understanding the problem space, user needs, and constraints.

## Key Principles

- **User First**: Every design decision starts with the user experience
- **Iterative**: We refine designs through multiple iterations
- **Data-Driven**: Research and testing inform our decisions
- **Collaborative**: Design is a team effort

## Tools & Methods

- User interviews and surveys
- Competitive analysis
- Wireframing and prototyping
- Usability testing
- Design sprints
