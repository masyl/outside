# API Documentation

This section tracks API reference coverage for the Outside platform.

## Current Status

API documentation is currently maintained manually in package source files and
project documentation.

## Planned Scope

- Shared APIs from `outside-core`
- Client-facing APIs from `outside-client`
- Server endpoints and contracts from `outside-server`
- Supporting scripting and integration interfaces

## Next Step

Add an automated API documentation generation pipeline and publish generated
reference pages under this section.
