# Missing Sprites and Placeholder Icons

This renderer uses placeholder icons from `@hackernoon/pixel-icon-library` for entities that do not yet have dedicated sprite art.

## Current Mappings (24px, light mode, solid)

- **Bot placeholder**: `robot.png`
- **Hero placeholder**: `user.png`
- **Food placeholder**: `apple.png`

## Notes

These icons are only used when no dedicated sprite sheet is available for the entity.
