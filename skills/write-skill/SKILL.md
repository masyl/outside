description: Creates a new project skill in the canonical skills directory following project conventions. Use when a new skill is needed, instead of creating vendor-specific skills.

# Write Skill – Ȯ

Creates a properly structured skill in the project's canonical `/skills` directory, ensuring consistency across all vendors and preventing skill duplication.

## When to use

- A user asks you to create a skill for the project
- A new capability needs to be encapsulated as a reusable skill
- You need to create a custom skill that should be available to all agents (Claude, Cursor, Gemini, OpenAI)
- Replacing or improving an existing skill

## When NOT to use

- Do NOT create skills in vendor-specific folders (`.claude/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, `.gemini/skills`, `.codex/skills`)
- Do NOT override vendor-provided skills without explicit project planning
- Those vendor folders are generated by syncing from `/skills` and will be overwritten

## Skill directory structure

```
skills/
├── [skill-name]/           # kebab-case directory name
│   └── SKILL.md            # The skill definition (only required file)
├── code-and-test-carefully/
├── create-pitch/
└── sync-vendor-skills/
```

## SKILL.md format

Every skill must contain exactly one `SKILL.md` file with this structure:

### Frontmatter (required)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name – Ȯ
description: One-line description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---
```

**Rules for frontmatter:**

- `name`: Must match the kebab-case directory name, followed by ` – Ȯ` (em-dash and special character)
- `description`: Concise one-liner (50-100 chars) stating purpose and usage
- Must use YAML format with three dashes before and after

### Content (required)

Structure your skill content to clearly explain:

```markdown
# Skill Name – Ȯ

[Brief paragraph describing what this skill does]

## When to use

- Bullet point describing a use case
- Another trigger condition
- What problem does this skill solve

## Key workflow / steps

[Main content explaining how agents should approach this skill]

### Subsections (as needed)

Organize complex skills with clear subsections that guide agent behavior.

## Anti-patterns / Common mistakes

- What NOT to do
- What NOT to assume
- Clarify boundaries and limitations
```

## Naming conventions

- **Directory name**: All lowercase, hyphens between words (kebab-case)
  - ✅ `write-skill`, `create-pitch`, `code-and-test-carefully`
  - ❌ `WriteSkill`, `write_skill`, `writeSkill`
- **Filename**: Always `SKILL.md` (capitalized)
- **Skill name in frontmatter**: Kebab-case + ` – Ȯ`

## Creating a new skill: step-by-step

1. **Plan the skill**
   - Define clear use cases and triggers
   - Identify when agents should invoke this skill
   - Document expected agent behavior

2. **Create the directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir skills/[your-skill-name]
   ```

3. **Write SKILL.md**
   - Follow the format above
   - Include frontmatter with correct name and description
   - Structure content with "When to use" and clear workflow sections
   - Make it actionable for agents (not just documentation)

4. **Test the skill**
   - Verify the directory and file exist
   - Check that frontmatter is valid YAML
   - Ensure description is clear and actionable

5. **Sync vendor skills** (required after creation)
   ```bash
   pnpm run sync:skills
   ```
   This makes your new skill available to all vendor agents (Claude, Cursor, Gemini, OpenAI).

## File location

All skills must be created in: `/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`

Do NOT create skills in:

- `.claude/skills/` (Claude vendor folder—auto-generated)
- `.cursor/skills/` (Cursor vendor folder—auto-generated)
- `.gemini/skills/` (Gemini vendor folder—auto-generated)
- `.codex/skills/` (OpenAI vendor folder—auto-generated)

## Examples

See existing skills in `/skills/`:

- `create-pitch/SKILL.md` – Formalized pitch creation
- `code-and-test-carefully/SKILL.md` – Rigorous debugging workflow
- `sync-vendor-skills/SKILL.md` – Syncing skills to vendors
- `create-delivery-branch/SKILL.md` – Git branch creation

## Important: Sync after creation

After creating a skill, ALWAYS run:

```bash
pnpm run sync:skills
```

This synchronizes your new skill to all vendor-specific folders, making it available across Claude, Cursor, Gemini, and OpenAI Codex agents.

Without this step, the skill will only exist in `/skills/` and won't be available to vendor tools.

## Skill discovery

Once synced, agents should be able to:

- Discover the skill in their environment
- See the skill name and description
- Use it when the described conditions are met

If an agent doesn't recognize your skill after syncing, the sync may have failed. Check:

1. Directory and file names match conventions (kebab-case, `SKILL.md`)
2. Frontmatter is valid YAML
3. `pnpm run sync:skills` ran successfully
