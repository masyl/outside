# Dingle Brawl

## Motivation

## Solution

Dingle Brawl is a game inspired by Calvin Ball. The concept is that a bunch of friends try to count points by going through a series of 1 minutes rounds that each have arbitrary rules told to them just as the round starts.

The goal is pure chaos.

RULES:

- No game is played the same and the rules always change.
- Game rules are basically randomly shuffled from a bag of available mechanics.
- Rules can sometimes be added, removed or changed during the round, "just because dingle says so" .
- Some rules can be surprises and be revealed only when they are triggered.
- Rule changes are made visible with short phrases and visual queues.
- Players can find powerups that can actually change the rules.
- Players can find cheats to help themselves win.
- Between every round, there is not a lot of time to strategize.
- Teams can be formed, broken or changed arbitrarily by Dingle, even during a round.
- Rounds can be suddenly cut short or extended, because Dingle says so.
- Lagging players are always given pittied and give better power ups.
- Dingle can give random arbitrary invented trophies.
