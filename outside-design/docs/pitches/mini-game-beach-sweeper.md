# Mini Game: Beach sweeper

- Messages in bottles:
  The player can put a message in a bottle, then throw it in the sea. This message will then be made available to other users, but without the option to know who will get it

- Meditation/Rumination:
  Game dialogues with yourself when alone in you airarium

- Parallel universe shadows ... bleed through

  See ghostly representations of what other players are doing on the same beach. Maybe as a way to trade stuff in real time ?

- You... to infinity!!!

  Each player is also playing a parallel version of the same main character. Because the interdimensionnal squid existence spans multiple nearby parallell universe. As a way to be more productive in it's mission.

# Messages in bottles

## Basic concept

The player can put a message in a bottle, then throw it in the sea. This message will then be made available to other users, but without the option to know who will get it:

## Variations

- Proactivelly share items
- Request and answer for specific items
- Send/receive hints for the current beach
- Deep toughts (with vote/selection mechanics)

## Pros

- Provides a connection to other players, without having to fully socialize.
- Fairly simple to moderate for safety
- Can be used in combination with mechanics of "user validation of content" to have gradually improving game assets
