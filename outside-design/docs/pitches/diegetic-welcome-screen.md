# Diegetic Welcome Screen

## Motivation

## Solution

When loading the game, a welcome screen should be presented to the user to give him options. Instead of a classic welcome screen with buttons, this welcome UI should be presented as a level with a blank bot already selected.

This welcome level would automatically started in host mode and give option to the user with game objects such as sign posts, books, doors and switches.
