## Mini-game: Chess

A special grid could host a game of chess as a mini-game, with the help of a chess bot.

- Add a set of objects for game pieces and black/white marble terrain.
- Add a chess master bot that can setup the board and determines if the board is in a logical state and if the next move can be played
- Allow the chess master to play is side of the game.
- Allow the chess master to reset the board area if asked.
- Create a zone with the ability to undo an object displacement.

Pre-requisites:

- Game mechanic for bots to take, move and put down objects
- Telekinesis: Make sure the object displacement can have a special case to reach far away pieces without being next to the object.
