## One-line Pitch Ideas

- Default terrain object
  - Add a default terrain type for level.
  - Use this default terrain as a first object added to ground layer.
  - The default terrain should be added to cover level boundaries and an additionnal 100 tiles on each sides.
  - Use this default terrain to fill up space beyond boundaries of level.
  - Draw a thick dashed white line around the level boundaries.
  - Allow adding objects outside the level boundaries
- Timeline Graphical Interface
  - Timeline
  - Time in hours, minutes, seconds
  - Command buttons

- Add a corner Logo
- Draw an dotted outline boundary for the grid
- Check if capping the framerate at 60 would reduce CPU load
