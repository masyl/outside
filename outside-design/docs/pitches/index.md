## One-line Pitch Ideas

- Default terrain object
  - Add a default terrain type for the level.
  - Use this default terrain as a first object added to the ground layer.
  - The default terrain should be added to cover the level boundaries and an additionnal 100 tiles on each sides.

  - Draw a thick dashed white line around the level boundaries.
  - Allow adding objects outside the level boundaries
