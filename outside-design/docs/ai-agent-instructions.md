# AI Agent Instructions

This document contains instructions for AI agents working on the Outside project.

## Pitch Phase

When proposing new features or system changes, create a pitch to frame the scope of development work.

### When to Create a Pitch

- After ideation is complete and we have a worthwhile idea
- Before beginning implementation work
- As the first step in planning work for any system modification

### Pitch Creation Process

1. Draft the pitch using the standard template and format requirements
2. Review the pitch in conversation with an AI agent using the review criteria
3. Refine based on feedback to achieve appropriate scope and clarity
4. Move to implementation planning

## Wrapup Phase

---

# Basic Unit Testing Implementation Plan

[Updated plan content reflecting actual work done]

```

### Important Notes

- Always update the plan to reflect reality, not the original intention
- Include what was actually built, even if it differs from the plan
- Document any important decisions or changes made during implementation
- The wrapup is a documentation step, not a code change step
- After wrapup, the user will commit and push the documentation changes
- **Do not retrofit older deliveries** - this new structure applies only to new work
```
