# Visual Debug Layer

A visual debug layer drawn between the ground layer and the surface layer that provides enhanced visualization of the game's internal state. The layer uses vector graphics, geometric shapes, text, and symbols with color coding for clarity, and is only visible when debug mode is active.

The visual debug layer includes a dot grid system positioned at tile corners, world boundary visualization, mouse position tracking with cursor tile highlighting, and bot position visualization with dotted squares. This provides developers with improved understanding of game state during debugging, reducing time spent identifying position and coordinate-related issues.
