# The Many Maanings of Outside

One of the main reason I chose to call this project and the engine "Outside" is that it is one of those very anbiguous and loaded word that is almost entirely defined by the contexte and the frame of reference in which it is used.

It allows me and eventually the builders and players to reflect on what it could mean and that answer could evolve and change.

The initial tagline being the "Go Play Outside" we all heard from our parents gives it an initial bent, but it's not a constraint on the future.

Here is a few things that went through my head when I made that choice ...

* Outside of my head
* Outside of the industry
* Outside of the common expectations
* Outside of my comfort zone
* Outside of the day-to-day
* Outside of the normative world
* Outside of the dying and enshitified internet
