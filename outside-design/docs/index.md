# Ȯutside Design Documentation

Welcome to the design documentation for the **Outside** game project.

## On The Meaning of "Design"

Here, the word design is not limited to graphical or UI design. Rather, it is the exercise of design is the broadest sense possible, without artificial partitions.

I believe this cohesive approach to documenting all aspects of the design process, without the typical departmental separations will be "a less efficient but more human way" to do things moving forward.

## Documentation Sections

### [Questions](./questions/index.md)

Before writing a pitch, a process of asking questions, looking for possible answers and formulating hypothesis is often necessary.

### [Pitches](/pitches/)

Proposals for new features, game mechanics or anything that should be considered as improvements in the game.

### 🎨 [Design Process](/design-process/)

Learn about our design methodology, research findings, and ideation process.

### 📋 [Built Plans](./built-plans/)

Completed implementation plans that have been archived. These documents reflect the actual work that was done, including work summaries, implementation details, and commit references.
