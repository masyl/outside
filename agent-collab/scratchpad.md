# Scratchpad

Random notes taken during development.


## DX & Velocity

- A "Local" mode is needed soon to make testing easier.
- Ability to remember levels and switch quickly between them to test live.
- Ability to have "scripted playbacks" when commands are issued at specific times.
- FUCK YEAH: Should I keep actual session state in the browser local storage? Or should there be a notion of "ongoing game session" that is more like a transportable TMUX session you connect to ?

## Brain dump

- Use React to structure the app
- DX: Show the build timestamp/age in thedebug panel
- Bring the debug panel into the game as a React component
- Render the debug panel a weird TUI+Pixel thing
- The "game server" HTML UI is not up to date
  - Should it even be in HTML ?
  - Maybe it should be a TUI ?
  - What is the scope or usage of this ?
  - Who is it for ?
  - Should the project distance itself from the "web-o-sphere" ?
  - If it's more than for "hosting" a game... should it be a "community" server ?
  - Should it show hosts ?
