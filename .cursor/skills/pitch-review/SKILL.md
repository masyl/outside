# Pitch Review

Reviews a pitch to improve its quality and surface questions that need answers before drafting an implementation plan. The review step runs after a first usable version of a pitch exists and before the implementation plan is written.

## When to use

- User asks to review a pitch or give feedback on a pitch
- A pitch has been written and the user wants to prepare for planning
- User mentions "pitch review", "review the pitch", or "ready for planning"

## Quality aspects

Evaluate the pitch against these aspects:

- **Writing:** Spelling, syntax, punctuation, phrase structure.
- **Meaning:** The document can be understood by anyone with basic understanding of software and games, without extensive technical expertise.
- **Process:** All required parts of the pitch are present or explicitly marked as not relevant (see [create-pitch](.cursor/skills/create-pitch/SKILL.md) template for standard sections)
- **Relationships:** Links and references help the reader understand the topic: less common concepts, source material, technical definitions, referenced documents, past deliveries.

## Questions to raise and answer

Surface and answer questions in these categories:

- **Clarity:** Questions that reduce ambiguity of meaning or intent.
- **Preferences:** Questions on preferences when multiple equivalent implementation approaches exist.
- **Missing:** Missing details that were left out for simplicity but are needed to create the implementation plan

## Workflow position

```text
Ideation → Pitch → **Pitch Review** → Implementation Plan → Implementation → Wrapup
```

Review output can be: a short review note, a list of fixes and open questions, or an updated pitch with corrections applied (confirm with the user).
